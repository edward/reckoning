== Requirements

=== Optional
* RSpec and RSpec On Rails for running specs

== Installation

* $ rake db:migrate

== Usage

* Begin using a text file to keep your hours in that follows the standard seen
  in vendor/plugins/time_cruncher/README.txt

  ** Install the TextMate bundle if you've got it; how about them macros?
